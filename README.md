### Hi there 👋

I'm a physicists and:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my PhD degree, I'm a first year student at Tufts University, and I'm interested in soft condensed matter, but also in some weird mathematics, such as differential forms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Julia, C, C++, and some other things that someday could be useful.
