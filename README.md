### Hello!

I'm a physicists and:

- I’m currently working on my PhD degree, I'm a first year student at Tufts University, and I'm interested in soft condensed matter.
- I'm also interested in pure mathematics, such as topolofy, differential geometry and differential forms.
- This is a place when you can find some of my current projects and look at my learning path as well.
- Enjoy!
