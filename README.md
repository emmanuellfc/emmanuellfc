### Hello!

I'm a physicists and:

- Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD degree at Tufts University, and I'm interested in soft condensed matter.
- In the past I was quite interested in heavy math, but not so much anymore.
- This is a place when you can find some of my current projects and look at my learning path as well.
- Enjoy!
